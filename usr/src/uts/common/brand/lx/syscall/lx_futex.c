/*
 * Futexes are a Linux-specific implementation of inter-process mutexes.
 * They are designed to use shared memory for simple, uncontested
 * operations, and rely on the kernel to resolve any contention issues.
 *
 * Most of the information in this section comes from the paper "Futexes
 * Are Tricky", by Ulrich Drepper.  This paper is currently available at:
 * http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/futex.pdf.
 *
 * A futex itself a 4-byte integer, which must be 4-byte aligned.  The
 * value of this integer is expected to be modified using user-level atomic
 * operations.  The futex(4) design itself does not impose any semantic
 * constraints on the value stored in the futex; it is up to the
 * application to define its own protocol.
 *
 * When the application decides that kernel intervention is required, it
 * will use the futex(2) system call.  There are 5 different operations
 * that can be performed on a futex, using this system call.  Since this
 * interface has evolved over time, there are several different prototypes
 * available to the user.  Fortunately, there is only a single kernel-level
 * interface:
 *
 * long sys_futex(void *futex1, int cmd, int val1,
 * 	struct timespec	*timeout, void *futex2, int val2)
 *
 * The kernel-level operations that may be performed on a futex are:
 *
 * FUTEX_WAIT
 *
 *	Atomically verify that futex1 contains the value val1.  If it
 *	doesn't, return EWOULDBLOCK.  If it does contain the expected
 *	value, the thread will sleep until somebody performs a FUTEX_WAKE
 *	on the futex.  The caller may also specify a timeout, indicating
 *	the maximum time the thread should sleep.  If the timer expires,
 *	the call returns ETIMEDOUT.  If the thread is awoken with a signal,
 *	the call returns EINTR.  Otherwise, the call returns 0.
 *
 * FUTEX_WAKE
 *
 *	Wake up val1 processes that are waiting on futex1.  The call
 *	returns the number of blocked threads that were woken up.
 *
 * FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET/FUTEX_WAKE_BITSET
 *
 *	Similar to FUTEX_WAIT/FUTEX_WAKE, but each takes an additional argument
 *	denoting a bit vector, with wakers will only waking waiters that match
 *	in one or more bits.  These semantics are dubious enough, but the
 *	interface has an inconsistency that is glaring even by the
 *	embarrassingly low standards that Linux sets for itself:  the timeout
 *	argument to FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET is absolute, not relative as it is for
 *	FUTEX_WAIT.  And as if that weren't enough unnecessary complexity,
 *	the caller may specify this absolute timeout to be against either
 *	CLOCK_MONOTONIC or CLOCK_REALTIME -- but only for FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET,
 *	of course!
 *
 * FUTEX_WAKE_OP
 *
 *	The implementation of a conditional variable in terms of futexes
 *	actually uses two futexes:  one to assure sequential access and one to
 *	represent the condition variable.  This implementation gives rise to a
 *	particular performance problem whereby a thread is awoken on the futex
 *	that represents the condition variable only to have to (potentially)
 *	immediately wait on the futex that protects the condition variable.
 *	(Do not confuse the futex that serves to protect the condition variable
 *	with the pthread_mutex_t associated with pthread_cond_t -- which
 *	represents a third futex.)  To (over)solve this problem, FUTEX_WAKE_OP
 *	was invented, which performs an atomic compare-and-exchange on a
 *	second address in a specified fashion (that is, with a specified
 *	operation).  Here are the possible operations (OPARG is defined
 *	to be 12 bit value embedded in the operation):
 *
 *	- FUTEX_OP_SET: Sets the value at the second address to OPARG
 *	- FUTEX_OP_ADD: Adds the value to OPARG
 *	- FUTEX_OP_OR: OR's the value with OPARG
 *	- FUTEX_OP_ANDN: Performs a negated AND of the value with OPARG
 *	- FUTEX_OP_XOR: XOR's the value with OPARG
 *
 *	After this compare-and-exchange on the second address, a FUTEX_WAKE is
 *	performed on the first address and -- if the compare-and-exchange
 *	matches a specified result based on a specified comparison operation --
 *	a FUTEX_WAKE is performed on the second address.  Here are the possible
 *	comparison operations:
 *
 *	- FUTEX_OP_CMP_EQ: If old value is CMPARG, wake
 *	- FUTEX_OP_CMP_NE: If old value is not equal to CMPARG, wake
 *	- FUTEX_OP_CMP_LT: If old value is less than CMPARG, wake
 *	- FUTEX_OP_CMP_LE: If old value is less than or equal to CMPARG, wake
 *	- FUTEX_OP_CMP_GT: If old value is greater than CMPARG, wake
 *	- FUTEX_OP_CMP_GE: If old value is greater than or equal to CMPARG, wake
 *
 *	As a practical matter, the only way that this is used (or, some might
 *	argue, is usable) is by the implementation of pthread_cond_signal(),
 *	which uses FUTEX_WAKE_OP to -- in a single system call -- unlock the
 *	futex that protects the condition variable and wake the futex that
 *	represents the condition variable.  The second wake-up is conditional
 *	because the futex that protects the condition variable (rather than the
 *	one that represents it) may or may not have waiters.  Given that this
 *	is the use case, FUTEX_WAKE_OP is falsely generic: despite allowing for
 *	five different kinds of operations and six different kinds of
 *	comparision operations, in practice only one is used.  (Namely, setting
 *	to 0 and waking if the old value is greater than 1 -- which denotes
 *	that waiters are present and the wakeup should be performed.) Moreover,
 *	because FUTEX_WAKE_OP does not (and cannot) optimize anything in the
 *	case that the pthread_mutex_t associated with the pthread_cond_t is
 *	held at the time of a pthread_cond_signal(), this entire mechanism is
 *	essentially for naught in this case.  As one can imagine (and can
 *	verify on just about any source base that uses pthread_cond_signal()),
 *	it is overwhelmingly the common case that the lock associated with the
 *	pthread_cond_t is held at the time of pthread_cond_signal(), assuring
 *	that the problem that all of this complexity was designed to solve
 *	isn't, in fact, solved because the signalled thread simply wakes up
 *	only to block again on the held mutex.  Cue a slow clap!
 *
 * FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE
 *
 *	If the value stored in futex1 matches that passed in in val2, wake
 *	up val1 processes that are waiting on futex1.  Otherwise, return
 *	EAGAIN.
 *
 *	If there are more than val1 threads waiting on the futex, remove
 *	the remaining threads from this futex, and requeue them on futex2.
 *	The caller can limit the number of threads being requeued by
 *	encoding an integral numerical value in the position usually used
 *	for the timeout pointer.
 *
 *	The call returns the number of blocked threads that were woken up
 *	or requeued.
 *
 * FUTEX_REQUEUE
 *
 *	 Identical to FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE except that it does not use val2.
 *	 This command has been declared broken and obsolete, but we still
 *	 need to support it.
 *
 * FUTEX_FD
 *
 *	Return a file descriptor, which can be used to refer to the futex.
 *	This operation was broken by design, and was blessedly removed in
 *	Linux 2.6.26 ("because it was inherently racy"); it should go without
 *	saying that we don't support this operation.
