.SH NAME
eventfd \- Linux-compatible user event notification facility
.SH SYNOPSIS

.LP
.nf
#include <sys/eventfd.h>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP

\fBeventfd\fR is a Linux-borne facility for sending and receiving user
events via a file descriptor.  While the facility itself is somewhat dubious
(it can be mimicked in an entirely portable way with a pipe), it is
small and straightforward and this implementation is entirely compatible
with its Linux antecedent; see \fBeventfd\fR(3C) for details.
