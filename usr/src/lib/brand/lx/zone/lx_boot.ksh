# BINARY REPLACEMENT
#
# This section of the boot script is responsible for replacing Linux
# binaries within the booting zone with native binaries.  This is a two-step
# process: First, the directory structure of the zone is validated to ensure
# that binary replacement will proceed safely.  Second, the Linux binaries
# are replaced with native binaries.
#
# Here's an example.  Suppose that you want to replace /usr/bin/zcat with the
# native /usr/bin/zcat binary.  Then you should do the following:
#
#	1.  Go to the section below labeled "STEP ONE" and add the following
#	    two lines:
#
#		safe_dir /usr
#		safe_dir /usr/bin
#
#	    These lines ensure that both /usr and /usr/bin are directories
#	    within the booting zone that can be safely accessed by the global
#	    zone.
#	2.  Go to the section below labeled "STEP TWO" and add the following
#	    line:
#
#		setup_native_cmd /usr/bin/zcat /native/usr/bin/zcat
#

#
# STEP ONE
#
# Validate that the zone filesystem looks like we expect it to.
#
safe_dir /lib
safe_dir /bin
safe_dir /sbin
safe_dir /etc
safe_opt_dir /etc/init
safe_opt_dir /etc/update-motd.d

#
# STEP TWO
#
# Replace Linux binaries with native binaries.
#
# XXX The lx_thunk code will perform a chroot, so these commands will not work
# if they are run by a non-privileged user.
#

setup_native_cmd /bin/netstat /native/usr/bin/netstat

#
# STEP THREE
